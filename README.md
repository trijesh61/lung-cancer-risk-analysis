# 🫁lung-cancer-risk-analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis

Welcome to the Lung Cancer EDA project! This repository contains a detailed exploratory data analysis on a lung cancer dataset. The aim is to understand the data patterns, relationships, and key features that contribute to lung cancer prediction.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Rows**: 3000
- **Features**: 16 (including categorical and numerical variables)

### Key Columns
- `GENDER`, `AGE`
- `SMOKING`, `YELLOW_FINGERS`, `COUGHING`, `CHEST_PAIN`
- `LUNG_CANCER` (Target Variable)

## 🔍 Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to explore and visualize the data, clean any inconsistencies, and gain insights that could help in building predictive models in future.
